OPENING CARTOON

The opening cartoon for King's Quest VI takes approximately
6 meg of hard drive space.  After watching the opening
cartoon you may choose to delete it.  To do so, you need to
type the following command sequence.

At the dos prompt, type:

cd \sierra\kq6 (or the directory in which you installed the game)
del *.seq

This will free up approximately 6 meg on your hard drive.

If you would like to see the opening cartoon AFTER you
have deleted it, you must reinstall the game.  Detailed
instructions for this are in your documentation.

The opening cartoon will be installed to your hard drive
in a compressed form.  Upon initial startup, the files
will decompress.  This process occurs only once during
initial startup of the game.  For this process to occur,
you MUST run the KQ6 batch file from the directory you
installed the game to.

------------------------------------------------------
SLOW MACHINES AND EGA SUPPORT

If you have a slow machine, or an EGA card, you will not
receive an opening cartoon.  Instead, you will receive a
text derivative of the opening cartoon.  A slow machine
is considered a machine that is slower than a 386sx 16 mhz.

GUIDEBOOK TO THE LAND OF THE GREEN ISLES

You may be tempted to (at some point) throw out the
Guidebook.  This is a warning not to, however.  This
guide contains detailed instructions to get past
certain points in the game.  You will not be able
to pass these points without the guide.

------------------------------------------------------
GAME MEMORY REQUIREMENTS

To play King's Quest VI, we require that you have
573,000 bytes of available memory.  That number is
applicable with only the internal PC speaker.  If you
have a sound card of any kind, we require 580,000
bytes of available memory.  If you notice some slowdowns
in the game, increase your base memory a little.
This will make it a little faster for all of you
speed demons out there.  To free up more memory
you can buy a memory manager, or you can create a
boot disk.  You can create a boot disk from the game
install program.

------------------------------------------------------
TIPS FOR FASTER LOADING

If you notice the game, or opening cartoon running
slowly, it may be due to a fragmented hard drive.  
There are many commercial and shareware hard
drive unfragmenting programs available.

------------------------------------------------------
TANDY 2500 (and some other models)

If you notice a tremendous slowdown on a Tandy machine,
it may be due to a lack of memory.  There have been
noted problems where the Tandy may report more memory
than it actually has.  The solution to this is to free
up more memory, or make a boot disk.

-----------------------------------------------------
VOICE AND SOUND EFFECTS

If you happen to notice your voice or the sound effects
in the game breaking up, we have included a utility with
the disks that will fix that.  The utility is called:

DCOMPAUD.EXE

To run this program, enter the directory you installed
the game to and type:

DCOMPAUD .\

It is very important that you type the command
exactly as shown.  This process will take between 2
and 5 minutes, based on machine speed.  You will
need an extra 2 meg on your hard disk to run this
program.

NEW USERS

If you are unfamiliar with Sierra's icon interface,
you may wish to select the HELP button from the
King's Quest VI title screen.

-----------------------------------------------------
OUT OF HANDLES

On machines with a high amount of RAM (over 8 meg),
you may occasionally experience an "Out of Handles"
error.  There is currently no way to fix this.
There are two solutions.  You may install to NOT
use extended memory, or just restart the game when
the error occurs.  We apologize for any inconvenience
this may cause.
